**The-Kitchen:** This is my HTML, CSS, JS & JS-DOM base Project for the Restaurant  Reservation System. there are some common pages like Home, Category, Menu, About, Contact, Reservation, Login & Signup. 

## We've been making healthy food last for 5 years, We are Served healthy food since 2018.

Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a place where people can savor exceptional food, unwind in a cozy ambiance, and make lasting memories with friends and family.

But it's not just about the food it's about the experience. Our friendly and attentive staff are dedicated to making your visit exceptional.
